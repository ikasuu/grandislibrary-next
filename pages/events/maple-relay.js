            <h2>What is Maple Relay?</h2>
            <p>Maple Relay is an event where you receive rewards for simply staying online. During the event, you will receive a reward daily for staying on 30 mins, 60 mins, 90 mins, and 180 mins. Each time you claim the daily reward, you will add a point to the "Total Claimed" counter. As you reach 12, 32, 56, and 80 reward claims, you will receive a special reward. This means that each day you can obtain a total of 4 reward claims</p>

            <h2>How do I participate?</h2>
            <p>To participate, your account must meet at least 1 of the following requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed <a href="https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/Blockbuster/Black_Heaven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Heaven</a> for Lotus Boss Entry</li>
                <li>Have at least <a href="http://forums.maplestory.nexon.net/discussion/comment/36177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MVP Bronze</a></li>
                <li>
                    Have at least 150 total <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/MapleStory/Spell_Trace_and_Star_Force#Star_Force_Enhancement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Force</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Star Force is the quickest method if you fill up all your Equip Slots and Star Force each one to 10 stars</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you meet 1 of the following requirements, you can accept the quest <strong>‘[Maple Relay] Play with Popoh and Get Login Rewards!’</strong> quest from the Maple Relay icon within the star event notifier on the left side of the screen. Upon accepting the quest, Maple Relay UI will pop up and login time will start to accumulate</p>
            <p>During the event, once you've accepted the quest on one character, you do not need to accept the quest again on another character. As well, there is no level requirement, all you need to do is stay logged on</p>
            <p>There is also a Keyboard Shortcut to open the Maple Relay UI that you can assign. Another way to open the UI is by accessing it from the star event notifier on the left side of the screen</p>
            <h2>Rewards</h2>
